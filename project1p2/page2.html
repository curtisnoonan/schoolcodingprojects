                        <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>Your Privacy Policy must also disclose why you collect this kind of data. Some examples include:
                            To help develop new services or improve your existing services
                            To send users emails about special offers, new services or other information they may be interested in
                            To personalize their sessions on your website in order to better fit their interests, such as offering them relevant, individually tailored content
                            If you already have a Privacy Policy for your website and you’re now launching a mobile app, you need to first consider what new types of personal data you’ll be collecting through the mobile app. Then, update your agreement to include the new changes: what you collect from the website and from the mobile app 
                            You should always inform users about any updates or changes to your Privacy Policy.
                            Disclose if any third parties are involved in collecting personal information in your name, i.e. you use MailChimp to collect email addresses to send weekly updates to your members.
                            Here are a few examples of common sections of a Privacy Policy:
                        </p>
                        <p>A Log Data disclosure section should inform users that certain data are collected automatically from the web browser users are using and through the web server you’re using: IP addresses, browser types (Firefox, Chrome etc.), browser versions and various pages that users are visiting
                            Buffer includes a sub-clause about log data in its clause about personal information that is automatically obtained from its users:=

                Here’s a list of questions that can guide you when drafting your own Privacy Policy:
                What kind of personal information do you collect?
                What kind of personal information is collected automatically, e.g. via the web server (Apache, nginx etc.)?
                What kind of third parties are collecting personal information from your users?
                How are you using that personal information?
                Do you send promotional emails (newsletters)? If yes, can users opt-out? If so, how?
