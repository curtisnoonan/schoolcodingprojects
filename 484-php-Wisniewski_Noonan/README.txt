After a brief issue with the password matching function in JavaScript the home.html site is fully functional. I've tested the PHP connection to the database with the use of the terminal and confirmed that the code in signup.php and login.php pages is functional and can access and modify the database. Further on the PHP code will generate a warning if there was a problem with either logging in or signing up. As I was having some issues with my browser, Curtis checked and confirmed that both PHP pages are opening fine and are working properly with the HTML. At that point we were done and now the website takes in the user information and inserts them into the database, and when the user wants to log in the other PHP page with takes the username and password, compares it to the records and determines whether the inputted password is correct.
