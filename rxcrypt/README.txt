Professor,

I was having an issue with creating an executable .jar file for this project, and so I am including 
the jfoenix-8.0.4.jar java library which is required for running our code in an IDE. For reference,
we used the NetBeans IDE with java 8.0.4.
Additionally, there are two .config files which are example configurations for a client and a server.
